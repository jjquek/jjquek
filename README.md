## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate from Imperial College, London's MSc Computing program. 

Before that, I completed a Philosophy (BA) at King's College, London.

As that might suggest, I'm a developer that loves to keep learning. 

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 

a project I've tentatively titled *Slow To Speak*. This is a long-term project I'm building from the ground up: writing the spec, wireframing, learning the full-stack, and deployment. Take a look at the repository pinned below for the ongoing story!
