## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate from Imperial College, London's MSc Computing program. 

I currently work as an Instructional Associate at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/).

Before my masters, I studied Philosophy (BA) at King's College, London.

As that might suggest, I'm a developer that loves to keep learning.
